<p>
Park It is a Smart Vehicle Authentication system for Societies It
uses Computer vision to identify vehicles by using images from data
sets matching roof tops of society cars, 
</p>
<p>its Primary authentication
system utilizes Qr-technology for low budget societies and also
provides a unique hash to each car in society</p>

<p>
We have used Android as a platform to develop an app where user has
to register and hence is checked for authorization. A QR code is
generated only after authentication and authorization of the user.
To capture the QR code we have used Pi camera, which uses Raspberry
Pi as a microcontroller to operate. To process and identify the QR
code we have used Open CV library.

<li>
A unique encrypted QR code for each vehicle owner, which ensures
that any outsider cannot replicate the same code and try to
enter the society.
</li>

An android application is developed to display the QR code which
ensures that the code is recognized even in low light conditions
or bad weather.

Minimizes the requirement of security guard as the opening and
closing of gate is automatic.
